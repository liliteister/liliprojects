## Python Data Web App Example

This purpose of this project is to build a simple python web app to explore a dataset while demonstrating skills in pandas, SQL using MySQL, python, plotly, and dash. 

Run `python supermarket_callbacks.py` to launch app.

The dataset is from Kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales. The dataset is included in this repository as CSV unfortunately.

The conda environment used to run this app is included in environment.yml.
